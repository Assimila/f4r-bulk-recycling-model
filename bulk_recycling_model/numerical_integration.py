"""
The utilities in this module are to assist with the vertical integration of atmospheric moisture,
to attain column densities of water vapour depth.

Generally a dataset comes in the form of a gridded 3+ dimensional array.
The pressure dimension may have coordinates [1000, 900, 800, 600, 400, 100] in millibars,
but the integral that we want to compute is from the surface (ie. surface pressure) to the top of the atmosphere,
which will vary from point to point, and in time.

If surface pressure at some (lat, lon) is 960 millibars,
then we want to make the integral from 960 to 0 millibars.
The gridded data value at 1000 millibars (below surface level) is usually NaN.

In addition to the gridded dataset, the user must provide a surface pressure dataset,
and they may also provide a third dataset that measures the integrand at surface level.
